# Welcome to Artificial Neural Netoworks to Artist

## About.
This is an introduction to Neural Networks for people interested on undestanding how they work and that they interested in using them for different projects. 

The tutorial is composed of several Jupyter Notebooks which a programming enviroment that  it to visualize and run code line by line or block by block directly on your browser.

The notebooks contains the code and information necessary to undestand simple perceptron neural networks, fully connected and convolutional neural networks which will run directly on your computer. 

## Why?
Artificial Neural Network models have become one of the most powerful machine learning tools and have beat almost every single algorithm in the areas of Classificaiton, Computer Vision and Natural Lenguage Processing. 

On the other hand, getting right into undestanding these models and how they work can be challenging specially for people that are not technical on math and computers sceince. 

With this in mind the notebooks have very high level explanations of these models while at the same time explaining in an easy way how they work. 

## Setup?

For this tutorial you will have to install several python packages. 

First install pip if you don't have it in your computer, pip is the most popular python manager and allow us to install packages with a single command. 

### Install first:
Then install the following packages:

**virtualenv**
To have our own separate enviroment
```pip install virtualenv```

**Jupyter Notebook**
To run the Jupyter notebooks 
```pip install jupyter```

**TensorFlow **
This the Google Neural Network builder which is commonly used for the companies AI projects. They just open source it and its awesome. 
Please follow the guide to install it below. 

https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/get_started/os_setup.html

**Keras**
Note: Install after tensorflow
This is a package that takes advantage of tensorflow capabilities to give use an easy to use coding interface to build any network. We will be using it to build of convolutional network models.

```pip install keras```

### Run to setup
Now lets run some command to setup the whole thing.

First got to the directory where you donwload the repo. 

Then lets create our virtual enviroment, and lets call it venv.
```virtualenv venv```

Lets get into it.

```source venv/bin/activate```

Now lets install everything that we need:
```pip install jupyter```
```pip install tensorflow```
```pip install keras```

Everything done. 
To start playing with the notebooks simply run:
```jupyter notebook```

This will open a browser window where you can select a notebook and start playing with them.
